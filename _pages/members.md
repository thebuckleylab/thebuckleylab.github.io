    <p>Christopher L.  Buckley graduated with a First Class Master of Physics from the University of Edinburgh in 2000 and then went on to study for an MSc in Evolutionary and Adaptive Systems at the University of Sussex in 2001. After several year's in the computer games industry, he returned to academia and completed his doctoral studies in cognitive robotics at the University of Southampton in 2008.  Following a postdoctoral position at the Riken Brain Science Institute in Tokyo, he returned to the University of Sussex as a lecturer in neural computation in 2014 and was promoted to senior lecturer in 2018 and to Professor of Neural Computation in 2022.</p>

    <p>Paul Kinghorn graduated with a First Class B.Sc. (Mathematics) from the University of Glasgow in 1988.  After 30 years working in Finance, he returned to academia and studied for an M.Sc. in Intelligent and Adaptive Systems at the University of Sussex, graduating with Distinction in 2019.  He then began a Ph.D. funded by the Sussex 4 year Neuroscience Ph.D. program, with a focus on computational neuroscience and, in particular, predictive coding. He is due to complete his doctoral studies in summer 2024. He is currently funded as a research fellow by UKRI Horizon Europe as part of the MetaTool project, with a focus on how Active Inference can explain metacognitive aspects (i.e. "awareness") of intelligent decision making in animals and machines.</p>

    <p>With a background in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science (BSc), Poppy Collis graduated with distinction from a Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems at the University of Sussex in 2022. Her PhD is funded by UKRI Horizon Europe as part of the MetaTool project led by the Universidad Polit√©cnica De Madrid, which aims to develop a computational model of tool invention in autonomous robotic systems. Her research looks at methods which use approximate Bayesian inference to describe intelligent decision-making in cognitive agents.</p>

      <p>Francesco completed a BSc in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience with the highest performance at Goldsmiths, University of London. Dissatisfied with existing theory in these fields, he is now pursuing a PhD at the intersection between Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning, focusing on brain-inspired learning algorithms and deep learning theory.
